A minimod for GZDoom with a grappling hook. Feel free to use or modify.

## How to use

Type `give GrapplingHook` in the console, then press User 3 to fire it. Hitting a monster will drag the monster to you, hitting a wall will drag you to the wall.

User 3 is not bound by default, see GZDoom options.
